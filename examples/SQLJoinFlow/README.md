# SQL Join Flow Example

## Overview

An application that demonstrates the capabilities of the TigonSQL library.
It performs an inner-join of two data streams and logs the result of the SQL command.

## Flow Runtime Arguments

When starting the Application from the command line, runtime arguments will need to be specified.

The only required property is:

```httpPort``` - The port to run the HTTP ingestion endpoints on; example: ```--httpPort=1433```


## Installation

Build the Application jar:

    MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m" mvn package -DskipTests -pl tigon-examples -am -amd -P examples

To start the Flow in the Standalone Runtime of Tigon (substituting for *version* and *httpPort*):

    $ ./run_standalone.sh /path/to/SQLJoinFlow-<version>.jar co.cask.tigon.sqljoinflow.SQLJoinFlow --httpPort=<httpPort>

The Flow exposes 2 ingestion endpoints:

    POST /v1/tigon/ageInput -d { "data" : [ <id>, <age> ] }

    POST /v1/tigon/nameInput -d { "data" : [ <id>, <name> ] }

The output is the inner-join of these two input streams on their ```id```s. A filter of age greater than 40 is applied
on the results.

The output will appear as:

    <id> : <name> : <age>
