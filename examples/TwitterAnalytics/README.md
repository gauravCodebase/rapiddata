# Twitter Analytics Example

## Overview

An application that collects Tweets and logs the top 10 hashtags used in the last minute.

## Twitter Configuration

In order to utilize the ``TweetCollector`` flowlet, which pulls a small sample stream via
the Twitter API, an API key and Access token must be configured. Follow the steps at
[Twitter oauth access tokens](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens)
to obtain these credentials. These configurations must be provided as runtime arguments to
the Flow prior to starting it in order to use the ``TweetCollector`` flowlet.

## Flow Runtime Arguments

When starting the Application from the command line, runtime arguments may need to be specified.

The required Twitter authorization properties (*oauth-properties*), as described in 
**Twitter Configuration** above, include all of these:

- ```oauth.consumerKey```
- ```oauth.consumerSecret```
- ```oauth.accessToken```
- ```oauth.accessTokenSecret```

## Installation

Build the Application jar:

    mvn clean package

To start the Flow in the Standalone Runtime of Tigon (substituting for *version* and *oauth-properties*):

    $ ./run_standalone.sh /path/to/TwitterAnalytics-<version>.jar co.cask.tigon.analytics.TwitterAnalytics [ oauth-properties ]

To start the Flow in the Distributed Runtime of Tigon (substituting for *version* and *oauth-properties*):

    $ ./run_distributed.sh <ZookeeperQuorum> <HDFSNamespace>
    > START /path/to/TwitterAnalytics-<version>.jar co.cask.tigon.analytics.TwitterAnalytics [ oauth-properties ]

The top ten hashtags used in the previous minute get recorded. In the case of standalone instance of Tigon,
the results will appear immediately in the Tigon command line interface; in the case of distributed instance of Tigon,
the results will be written to the logs of the YARN container of the Flowlet.
