# Hello World Example

## Overview

An application that emits and counts "Hello World" messages.

## Building the JAR

    mvn clean package

To start the Flow in the Standalone Runtime of Tigon (substituting for *version*):

    $ ./run_standalone.sh /path/to/HellWorld-<version>.jar co.cask.tigon.helloworld.HelloWorldFlow 

To start the Flow in the Distributed Runtime of Tigon (substituting for *version*):

    $ ./run_distributed.sh <ZookeeperQuorum> <HDFSNamespace>
    > START /path/to/HellWorld-<version>.jar co.cask.tigon.helloworld.HelloWorldFlow

The HelloWorld Flow logs a "Hello World" message and a total count every second. If run in
the Standalone Runtime, the logs appear on the console. In the Distributed Runtime, the
```showlogs``` CLI command can be used to view these logs.
